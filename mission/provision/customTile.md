### Create a Home Page Tile for your Extension Application

As an administrator of the SAP SuccessFactors system, you can create custom tiles and add them to the home page in your instance.

You can create custom tiles using an easy step-by-step configuration wizard. Create custom content with a built-in rich-text editor, insert your own custom HTML, or display dynamic content from a third party.

For each custom tile, you can also configure the target audience and active dates when it appears on the home page. You can create up to 100 custom tiles.
